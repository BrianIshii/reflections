How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory because you can add files from the working directory. It is where you bundle the files, and then these files are added to the repository. The value it offers is that you get to choose what you want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
The pros of automatically merging files is that you can add stuff quickly. The problem is when one of the files is modified by the two different branches, the branches will not merge. The benefit then goes to manually merging files. The branches then can be modified. Manually merging is good when there are two different changes, but it takes longer.
