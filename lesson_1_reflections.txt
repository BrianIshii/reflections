Diff helped view the difference between two versions because it
went though the code very quickly.
2
Easy access to the entire history will let you quickly go back and 
see the changes you made to previous versions

the pros to manually choosing when to create a commit are:
you will be able to commit when you want to,
you can commit in small or large units, and
you can always make sure a task is finished
the cons to maually choosing when to create a commit are:
you may forget,
the manuel commits may be too infrequent or too frequent,
and more

git saves multiple files in one commit to see all the changes to all the files. It would be inefficient if a commit had to be separately done for each file.
I can use git log to see log of commits, and then I use git diff <commit number1> <commitnumber2> to see changes 
this will help you see the history
5
version control allows one to become more confident when breaking something because it allows easy access to previous versions. To open an old verion use git checkout <commitnumber>

I want to use git for all of my version controls and backups
