When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when you are working from multiple computers or with other people.
If you only work local you will only be able to work on the code from one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might want to pull manually because you may not want the updated verson of code. If you are working on something in your remote repository you may not want so stuff just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone from another person and it is on github. Forks are clones, but on github. Clones are copies of a respository. Branches are different versions of code. You would use forks one github. You would use clone when putting it on a your computer, and you would make branches on your computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally because you can check if it will be a fast forward merge so you don't have to worry about it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be harder to collaborate without Github becuase you would have no means of communication. With git you can only work remotely, but with github you can work on the website and communicate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You would want to make changes to a sepereate branch rather than directly on the master when you are messing  with code. This benefit will allow you to add to the code without breaking the master version
