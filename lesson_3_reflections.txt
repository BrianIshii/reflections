When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when you are working from multiple computers or with other people.
If you only work local you will only be able to work on the code from one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might want to pull manually because you may not want the updated verson of code. If you are working on something in your remote repository you may not want so stuff just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone from another person and it is on github. Forks are clones, but on github. Clones are copies of a respository. Branches are different versions of code. You would use forks one github. You would use clone when putting it on a your computer, and you would make branches on your computer.
